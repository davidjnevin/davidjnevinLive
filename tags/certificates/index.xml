      <description>This post is a culmination of previous project related posts. It&amp;rsquo;s useful for me to see the needs develop and to decide when and what to implement and how I can combine the requirements into clear actions to take.
Sidebar Although I chose the minima theme for it&amp;rsquo;s simplicity, it&amp;rsquo;s purpose was to present a personal writing related site. I wanted and still do want a clean experience for the writing posts and pages.</description>

      <description>Certificates Section Next mini-project here on this site is to start to put together a list of certificates and courses I&amp;rsquo;ve done. I am loath to do it in html as opposed to some kind of db solution but we&amp;rsquo;ll see.
First I want to get something visible and linkable, as I&amp;rsquo;m unhappy with the LinkedIn certificates section. Too inflexible and not customizable.
It might be as simple as creating new subsection and a matching hugo archetype for certificates.</description>
