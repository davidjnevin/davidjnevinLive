      <description>Too Many Vim Commands Getting back into Vim again and decided this time to take it slower and get the basics well in place before I try and incorporate too many commands. It&amp;rsquo;s the same mentality I&amp;rsquo;m bringing to my Python journey and will reapply to C#. The note below are a mix of my obsidian notes from when I started using Vim in April of 2021 and resources I&amp;rsquo;ve used to better understand the commands this time round.</description>

      <description>Binary Search Recommended Youtube Playlist Binary searching has been a difficult learning curve for me. It didn&amp;rsquo;t immediately click, so I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing a series of tutorials on youtube. This playlist is excellent.
So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten my head around the binary Search itself, Find Closest NUmber, FInd fixed Point, Find Bitonic Peak, Find First Occurrence.
Later I went through and studied Bisect Method, Square Root and Cyclically Shifted Array.</description>
