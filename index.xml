      <title>Hugo Section Theme 3</title>

      <description>Okay so that&amp;rsquo;s better. A simpler approach worked. I got playing with a copy of my primary *.html pages in the theme layout folder. I followed the advice to create a subfolder with the same name as my section.
I copied in my files and then altered them there. Also I added a _index.md to my section folder in the content folder.
These tweaks allowed me to alter the site title, adding a link to the section homepage as an additional text in the original title.</description>

      <title>Hugo Section Theme 2 (didn&#39;t work)</title>

      <description>Question: If I just copy the template? What happens if I just copy the single.html into the layout/code folder?
This is what happens, which in hindsight makes sense.
I copied over the partial in question and plonked it into the same sub-folder. That didn&amp;rsquo;t work.
I tried copying over the partials, editing the references in the template but without knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing I don&amp;rsquo;t know ifI&amp;rsquo;m getting closer or not to a solution or just digging a hole.</description>

      <description>Hugo Section: A different look and feel. I though that in order to set a different look and feel for a Hugo section, I&amp;rsquo;d create a folder in the current theme layout folder with the same name as the section. In my case that&amp;rsquo;s code.
The theme I&amp;rsquo;m interested in using and adapting is Book or Geekdoc but both require the extened Hugo version. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what that will do to my main site and SASS setup with gulp, so I&amp;rsquo;m steering clear of that for now.</description>

      <description>Raison d&amp;rsquo;être o el porque I built and deployed the Beta version of the critique wheel site in response to a need for the fiction writers in my writing groups to get faster and more actionable critiques on their short stories.
From my Github records, I added the .gitignore on 15 May 2021, so I consider that the start date of the project.

      <description>Start here As of today, I&amp;rsquo;ve been re-experimenting with programming for 13 months.
This is the first blog post on the topic of my coding experiences. I&amp;rsquo;ve no doubt this layout will develop and mature as I add content.
I hope it serves as a useful resource for anyone that stumbles across it.
This Site This site itself is built using Hugo, a static site generator written in Go. I don&amp;rsquo;t know Go and Hugo doesn&amp;rsquo;t require any deep programming skills.</description>

      <description>Critique Wheel The Critique Wheel is a free critique exchange for fiction writers.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and designed to handle short fiction in chunks of up to 8,000 words.
The idea is to help writers get useful critique on their works in progress while helping others do the same.
The benefits are many, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to improve your craft, gain confidence in your voice and get better and better at rewriting.</description>

      <description>Writing in Good Company We need that quiet time, that space to let our thought coalesce into words and those into sentences.
Writing and moreover improving our writing, I believe, requires a social element too.
There is in the very nature of the art a yearning for external eyes and minds to experience our words and worlds.
To this end I&amp;rsquo;ve founded and organized groups in three different cities so far.</description>

      <description>Publishing I caught the publishing bug way back in secondary school. I helped edit and publish the school magazine for a few issues. It was a joy to play with typesetting and layouts, plus seeing my own and my fellow contributors in print. The sensation of making words somehow more real has stayed with me.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on putting together two books. An anthology of short fiction and a non-fiction work related to the craft of writing.</description>

      <description>Why exchange critiques? For over seven years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exchanging critiques and it is the best way to improve your craft.
A good critique has these three characteristics For me, at they very least, a good critique should be objective, generous and actionable.
Objective: While the first may appear obvious, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for the critiquer to remember this is not a customer is always right scenario. The purpose should be to give the writer an insight into how the piece works in that reader&amp;rsquo;s head and not to get the writer to change something.</description>
