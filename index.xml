      <description>Critique Wheel The Critique Wheel is a free critique exchange for fiction writers.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and designed to handle short fiction in chunks of up to 8,000 words.
The idea is to help writers get useful critique on their works in progress while helping others do the same.
The benefits are many, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to improve your craft, gain confidence in your voice and get better and better at rewriting.</description>

      <description>Writing in Good Company We need that quiet time, that space to let our thought coalesce into words and those into sentences.
Writing and moreover improving our writing, I believe, requires a social element too.
There is in the very nature of the art a yearning for external eyes and minds to experience our words and worlds.
To this end I&amp;rsquo;ve founded and organized groups in three different cities so far.</description>

      <description>Publishing I caught the publishing bug way back in secondary school. I helped edit and publish the school magazine for a few issues. It was a joy to play with typesetting and layouts, plus seeing my own and my fellow contributors in print. The sensation of making words somehow more real has stayed with me.
I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on putting together two books. An anthology of short fiction and a non-fiction work related to the craft of writing.</description>

      <description>Why exchange critiques? For over seven years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been exchanging critiques and it is the best way to improve your craft.
A good critique has these three characteristics For me, at they very least, a good critique should be objective, generous and actionable.
Objective: While the first may appear obvious, it&amp;rsquo;s crucial for the critiquer to remember this is not a customer is always right scenario. The purpose should be to give the writer an insight into how the piece works in that reader&amp;rsquo;s head and not to get the writer to change something.</description>
