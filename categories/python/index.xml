      <description>Binary Tree Terms A tree has a root and leaves.
A root node has no parent nodes.
A leaf node has zero children.
The lines between nodes are called edges.
Binary Tree Characteristics In a binary tree, each node has a maximum of two children. In a classic binary tree there is one root. There is only one unique path from any node to the root An empty tree has no nodes, and should be considered a binary tree.</description>

      <description>Finished the Arrays section I&amp;rsquo;ve been working through the Data Structures and Algorithms course on Educative to develop my python skills.
Learned the two sum problem, optimal task assignment, intersections of two sorted lists, arbitrary precision increment and array advance games solutions.
Fascinating look into the the world of algorithms. Lots more to se of course but really enjoying the progress and the insights.
I also did a quick &amp;ldquo;level test&amp;rdquo; and received a proficiency badge.</description>
