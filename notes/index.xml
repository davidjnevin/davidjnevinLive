      <description>Sharing the Craft In 2011, I decided I wanted to get serious about improving my writing craft. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time or the resources to take a &amp;lsquo;recognized&amp;rsquo; course and knew self-study it would be a long and interrupted road.
 I&amp;rsquo;ve always found sharing is a better approach to learning, for all involved.
 I founded the Madrid Writers&#39; Club for company on the journey. The group is still going strong and the format hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed much since I left Madrid and came to live in Valencia.</description>

      <description>Critique Wheel The Critique Wheel is a free critique exchange for fiction writers.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and designed to handle short fiction in chunks of up to 8,000 words.
The idea is to help writers get useful critique on their works in progress while helping others do the same.
The benefits are many, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to improve your craft, gain confidence in your voice and get better and better at rewriting.</description>
