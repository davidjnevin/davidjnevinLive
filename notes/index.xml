      <description>Critique Wheel The Critique Wheel is a free critique exchange for fiction writers.
It&amp;rsquo;s easy to use and designed to handle short fiction in chunks of up to 8,000 words.
The idea is to help writers get useful critique on their works in progress while helping others do the same.
The benefits are many, but in short it&amp;rsquo;s one of the best ways to improve your craft, gain confidence in your voice and get better and better at rewriting.</description>
